# EV Range Prediction

This project predicts the estimated range of electric vehicles based on specifications like battery capacity, torque, efficiency, and number of cells.

## Files

- `main.ipynb` : Jupyter notebook with data analysis and modeling.
- `electric_vehicles_spec_2025.csv` : Dataset of EV specifications.

## How to Run

1. Open `main.ipynb` in Jupyter or Colab.
2. Ensure all required Python packages are installed (pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn).
3. Run the notebook step by step to perform analysis and predictions.
